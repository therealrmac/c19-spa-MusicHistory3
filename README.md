Loop over results and inject into Music History list view.
Add delete button to each row and, when it is clicked, delete the entire row in the DOM.
##### Part Two

Take your music and split it into two JSON files instead of them all living on one file.
Add a button at the bottom of your music list and label it More >.
Load the songs from the first list, and inject the DOM into the document as you've already done.
